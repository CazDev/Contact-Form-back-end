# Contact-Form-back-end
I was recieving lots of spam emails through my websites contact form so I created this to prevent this problem from happening. (5 months later still no spam and expect it to stay this way)

A back end PHP contact form script with non-capcha spam detection, IP, operation system and browser logging.

Strings containing "TODO" need to be filled out in order to send and receive an email

Requires PHPMailer: 
https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

Fields named 'website', 'email' and 'message' will be used as honeypot fields to test for bots.
